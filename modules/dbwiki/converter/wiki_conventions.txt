* Paragraph is delimited by empty lines. It can contain as well blocks
  or lists (which can have empty lines inside them).

* Lists are denoted by bullets and indentation.
  Bullets can be: (*|1.|a.|A.|i.|I.), the items of the same list have
  the same bullet and indentation. A list item can contain sublists,
  blocks, empty lines, etc. A slash (/) is used to end a list, if
  there is ambiguity.

* Blocks are denoted by a starting line (--xxx) and an ending line
  (----). Blocks are:

    * programlisting (--code), literallayout (--ll), screen (--scr)

    * figure (--fig title), example (--xmp title)

    * admonitions: --n or --note, --c or --caution, --w or --warning,
      --tip, --imp or --important,


* Inline marks are denoted by special characters and are contained
  inside a single line (cannot span multiple lines). They are:

    * Links: [link_name > href]
      [...] should be escaped like this: \[...]

    * Footnotes: [/...]

    * Menu items: [Options->General->Save (Ctrl-S)]

    * Prompt and command are separated by '!#' in a single line:
      prompt!# command
      (escaped like this '\!#')

    * Filename: ~filename~, emphasis: _word_

    * Images: [< filename < width < alt ]

    * xref: [> section_id ]

* CDATA sections are denoted by [[xyz]]. This markup can be escaped
  by preceding it by \ (like \[[xyz]]). As a shortcut,
    --code--
    xyz
    ----
  is equivalent to:
    --code
    [[xyz]]
    ----
  The same can be done for --screen, --scr, and --ll.
