About DocBookWiki
-----------------

DocBookWiki is about creating, editing and publishing simple DocBook
documents, quickly and easily, from a web interface.

It uses a simple text markup syntax, similar to a wiki markup, to
denote some of the most commonly used DocBook elements. Then, this
markup is converted to HTML for being displayed on a browser, and to
XML for exporting the documents in the DocBook/XML format.

The number of tags/elements that can be used in a DocBook document is
huge (see: http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/part2.html).  However,
fortunately, the structure of a DocBook document is very flexible, not
all of the tags are required, and with a very small subset of them one
can write pretty good DocBook documents. DocBookWiki employs a very
small subset of DocBook tags, which usually are enough to write
manuals or other technical documents for programs or applications.

There is already a Book module in Drupal, which takes care of the book
layout and navigation (the hierarchy of the pages and their order and
relation to each other). DocBookWiki extends the features of this
module by adding a wiki-like editing mode and by adding the ability to
import and export DocBook/XML documents.


Drush Commands of DocBookWiki
-----------------------------

+ Get help:

      drush topic docbook
      drush help --filter=docbook
      drush help dbw-list
      drush help dbw-export
      drush help dbw-import
      drush help docbook2dbw


+ Print a list of DocBook-s:

      drush dbw-list


+ Export a book from DocBookWiki in DocBook(XML) format:

      rush dbw-export test-docbook > test.xml

  The result of export is sent to the standard output, so we should
  redirect it to another file.


+ Import a DocBook document into DocBookWiki:

      drush dbw-import $(pwd)/file.xml

  The file given as argument is expected to have an absolute path or
  to be relative to the drupal path. For convenience we can use $(pwd)
  in front of it, which will expand to the current working directory
  (as an absolute path).

  The DocBook/XML file that is imported is expected to be conform the
  simple structure of the DocBookWiki, that is it contains only
  elements and attributes that are reckognized and can be processed by
  DocBookWiki and they are used in the correct structure.

  For example, a DocBook file that is exported from DocBookWiki will
  always be valid for being imported into DocBookWiki. However, if we
  have an external DocBook file that we wish to import to the system,
  we need to preprocess it first and make sure that it is in the
  correct format, before trying to import it.


+ Preprocess a DocBook document, so that it becomes suitable for being
  imported to DocBookWiki:

      drush docbook2dbw $(pwd)/docbook.xml > dbw.xml

  The result of conversion is sent to the standard output, so we
  should redirect it to another file. It makes these transformations
  to the input file:
    1. The elements <sect1>, <sect2>, <sect3>, <sect4>, <sect5> are
       converted to <section>.
    2. If a section element that needs to have an 'id' attribute
       (chapter, section, simplesect, appendix, bibliography) is
       missing it, a unique id (generated automatically) is added to
       it.
    3. Any extra tags that are not reckognized by DocBookWiki are
       stripped off but their text content is preserved.

  Of course, this conversion is based on heuristics and is not
  guaranteed to work correctly 100% of the times. Maybe it is possible
  to build a conversion tool that works correctly all the times, but
  it should be very complex (due to complexity and flexibility of
  DocBook). A simpler solution is to customize the conversion tool for
  the specific case of the documents that you want to convert.

  The command 'docbook2dbw' can be customized by putting the specific
  xsl files on the directiry 'docbook/import/xslt/docbook2dbw/' and
  then including them at the end of the file
  'docbook/import/xslt/docbook2dbw.xsl' like this:

      <xsl:include href="docbook2dbw/author.xsl" />
